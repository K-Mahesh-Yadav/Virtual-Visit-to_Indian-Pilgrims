                <h2>Badrinarayana Temple</h2>
                <p>
                Badrinath or Badrinarayana Temple is a Hindu temple dedicated to Vishnu. It is situated in the town of 
                Badrinath in Uttarakhand, India. The temple is also one of the 108 Divya Desams dedicated to Vishnu - 
                holy shrines for Vaishnavas - who is worshipped as Badrinath. It is open for six months every year 
                (between the end of April and the beginning of November), because of extreme weather conditions in the 
                Himalayan region. The temple is located in Garhwal hill tracks in Chamoli district along the banks of 
                Alaknanda River. It is one of the most visited pilgrimage centers of India, having recorded 2.8 million 
                (28 lakh) visits in just 2 months in 2022.

                The image of the presiding deity worshipped in the temple is a 1 ft (0.30 m), the black granite deity of 
                Vishnu in the form of Badrinarayan. The deity is considered by many Hindus to be one of eight svayam vyakta 
                kshetras, or self-manifested deities of Vishnu.

                <h2>History of Badrinath temple</h2>
                <p>
                There is no historical record about the temple, but there is a mention of the presiding deity Badrinath in 
                Vedic scriptures (c. 1750–500 BCE).[6] According to some accounts, the shrine was worshipped in some form in 
                the Vedic period. The architecture of the temple resembling that of a Buddhist vihara (temple) and the brightly 
                painted facade which is atypical of Buddhist temples leads to the argument.[2] Other accounts relate that it was 
                originally established as a pilgrimage site by Adi Shankara in the ninth century. It is believed that Shankara 
                resided in the place for six years from CE 814 to 820. He resided six months in Badrinath and the rest of the year 
                in Kedarnath. Hindu followers assert that he discovered the deity of Badrinath in the Alaknanda River and enshrined 
                it in a cave near the Tapt Kund hot springs.[8][10] A traditional story asserts that Shankara expelled all 
                the Buddhists in the region with the help of the Parmar ruler king Kanak Pal, however this might be fictitious 
                and very recent. The hereditary successors of the king governed the temple and endowed villages to meet its 
                expenses. The income from a set of villages on the route to the temple was used to feed and accommodate pilgrims. 
                The Parmar rulers held the title "Bolanda Badrinath", meaning speaking Badrinath. They had other titles, including 
                Shri 108 Basdrishcharyaparayan Garharaj Mahimahendra, Dharmabibhab, and Dharamarakshak Sigamani.
